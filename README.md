# Jot

This web app allows users to anonymously post short stories or journal entries.
It's writen with React classical components.

## Features

This app features full **`CRUD`** functionality. Allowing users to fully control their posts while a simple password feature keeps users from affecting others.

## Motivation

Oftentimes, writers like to create short stories just as part of practicing their craft. Many of these stories never see the public eye.
My app will give them a place to share these "throwaways" so that they no long have to go to waste.

## Challenges Faced in development

This app was written using React classical components because I had less familiarity with this style. This project has made me more comfortable with prop-drilling, and getting stateful and non-stateful components to work together.

## Future Updates

I will revist this project in the future. Some updates to look out for:

+ Updated UX/
+ Cleaner File Structure
+ Community Interaction Functionality (LIkes and Comments)
+ The Ability to search for post by user or title
